Code Louisville Project

The website is a basic responsive portfolio that displays some of the websites that
I have developed and designed in the past. Some of the technologies used in the site include jQuery, Bootstrap, media queries, modal dialog boxes.

Although the site seems simple and I could have done something larger, I decided to spend my time focusing and improving some weak areas. The areas that I focused most of my time on is commenting and clean formatting it is one of the areas that gets ignored in the realworld and many of the sites I have worked on or received from outsourcing projects in my workplace.
